Project 1:
Zip Code Search App

- In this project, you will build a simple Zip Code search app
- Need an input filed where the user can enter a zip code, like in the following image:

- We will use the user input to search the ctp-zip-api. If the zip code is valid the API will respond with an object for each city. Use that response to display each city in a separate div like in the following image:

After Search: https://github.com/CUNYTechPrep/week-03-projects/blob/master/zip-search-2.png

http://ctp-zip-api.herokuapp.com/zip/10016

Provide the zipcode in the url and you will receive a JSON response with an array containing an object for each city found.
